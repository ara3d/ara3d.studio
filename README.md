# Ara 3D Studio

Ara 3D Studio is a free program for loading, transforming, viewing, and exporting large 3D models designed specifically for architecture, engineering, construction, infrastructure, and geo-spatial data.   

This repository houses the binary releases of the program, the open-source core library components (math, geometry, import, export), and the scripting API.

## The Scripting API

Ara 3D has an integrated C# scripting engine. Tools and scripts that you write for Ara 3D Studio can be run virtually anywhere and require no licensing fees or restrictions.    

## Part Open-Source and Closed-Source

The main application and rendering system in Ara 3D Studio is closed-source, however much of the API (including libraries for math, geometry, importing, are exporting data) are made available 
as commerically friendly MIT-licensed open-source libraries. 

Having that the entire community, including ourselves, will benefit from having a free and open high-quality geometry kernel. The more that people use and review the library, the more robust and useful 
it will become.
